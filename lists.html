    <h1>Thai Seafood Sauce</h1>
    <p>
        This Thai seafood sauce recipe is notoriously delicous and is found all over Thailand. I love it because it combines spicy, sour, salty, and some sweet all in one. It is an excellent and complimentary sauce to seafood of all sorts. The ingredients are
        used as a guide only and not as strict amounts. It is advised to add and taste to your own preference!

    <!-- Unordered list of ingredients needed -->
    <ul>
        <li>15 Thai birds eye chilies (พริกขี้หนูสวน)</li>
        <li>8 - 10 Cloves of garlic (กระเทียม)</li>
        <li>6 - 10 tablespoons of lime (น้ำมะนาว)</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of water (น้ำเปล่า)</li>
        <li>
            2 - 4 Tablespoons of fishsauce (น้ำปลา). An alternate can be salt and some fishsauce if you do not like the 'fishy' sauce flavor. Some Thai folks prefer using salt in their seafood sauce. Also, the water and lime can cut the salty taste so add accordingly.
        </li>
        <li>1/2 Teaspoon of salt for pounding the chilies and garlic in the mortal/pestle.</li>
        <li>1 Tablespoon of sugar or preferably, palm sugar (น้ำตาล)</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <li>
            Add the Thai birds eye chilies and peeled garlic into a mortar and pestle. Toss in 1/2 teaspoon of salt, start pounding until chilies and garlic are smashed. Make sure that all of the oils are released and seeds are crushed. The alternative way is the
            throw everything into a blender but the traditional way is the mortar and pestle. &#127798; | &#129476;
        </li>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Important Side Note:</strong> Pound with caution! Do not look directly down into the mortar and pestle while pounding to avoid chili seeds flying up into your eyes! You can use a paper towel to cover the top of the mortar while
                pounding instead for added safety. &#9888;
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>Scoop out the crushed chilies and garlic with a spoon and put it into a bowl.</li>
        <li>
            Add your lime juice, water, and fish sauce back into the mortar and pestle to get the extra oil stuck in the walls of the mortar. This is where a lot of the real flavor is hiding! Stir.
        </li>
        <li>Pour the juice into the bowl of crushed chilies and garlic.</li>
        <li>
            Taste and repeat to until if fits your preference. Enjoy! &#127869;
