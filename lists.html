        <h1>Thai Seafood Sauce</h1>

        <!-- Paragraph Description -->
        <p>This Thai seafood sauce recipe is notoriously delicous and is found all over Thailand.
           It is an excellent and complimentary sauce to seafood of all sorts. I love it because
           it combines all elements of spicy, sour, salty, and sweet. The ingredients are
           used as a guide only and not as strict amounts. It is advised to add and taste to your
           own preference!</p>

        <!-- Unordered list of ingredients needed -->
        <ul>
            <li>15 Thai birds eye chilies (‡∏û‡∏£‡∏¥‡∏Å‡∏Ç‡∏µ‡πâ‡∏´‡∏ô‡∏π‡∏™‡∏ß‡∏ô)</li>
            <li>8 - 10 Cloves of garlic (‡∏Å‡∏£‡∏∞‡πÄ‡∏ó‡∏µ‡∏¢‡∏°)</li>
            <li>6 - 10 tablespoons of lime (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏°‡∏∞‡∏ô‡∏≤‡∏ß)</li>
            <li>3 Tablespoons of water (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡πÄ‡∏õ‡∏•‡πà‡∏≤)</li>
            <li>2 - 4 Tablespoons of fishsauce (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏õ‡∏•‡∏≤). An alternate can be salt and some fishsauce
                if you do not like the 'fishy' sauce flavor. Some Thai folks prefer using salt in
                their seafood sauce. Also, the water and lime can cut the salty taste so add accordingly.</li>
            <li>1/2 Teaspoon of salt for pounding the chilies and garlic in the mortal/pestle.</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon of sugar or preferably, palm sugar (‡∏ô‡πâ‡∏≥‡∏ï‡∏≤‡∏•)</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- Ordered list of step by step cooking instructions -->
        <ol>
            <li>
                Add the Thai birds eye chilies and peeled garlic into a mortar and pestle. Toss in 1/2 teaspoon of salt, start pounding until chilies and garlic are smashed. Make sure that all of the oils are released and seeds are crushed. The alternative way is the
                throw everything into a blender but the traditional way is the mortar and pestle. &#127798; | &#129476;
            </li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Important Side Note:</strong> Pound with caution! Do not look directly down into the mortar and pestle while pounding to avoid chili seeds flying up into your eyes! You can use a paper towel to cover the top of the mortar while
                    pounding instead for added safety. &#9888;
                </li>
            </ul>
            <li>Scoop out the crushed chilies and garlic with a spoon and put it into a bowl. ü•£</li>
            <li>
                Add your lime juice, water, and fish sauce back into the mortar and pestle to get the extra oil stuck in the walls of the mortar. This is where a lot of the real flavor is hiding! Stir. ü•Ñ | üëÄ
            </li>
            <li>Pour the juice into the bowl of crushed chilies and garlic. ü•£ | ü•µ</li>
            <li>
                Taste and repeat to until if fits your preference. Enjoy! &#127869;
