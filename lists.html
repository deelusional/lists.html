    <!-- Unordered list of ingredients needed -->
    <ul>
        <li>15 Thai birds eye chilies (พริกขี้หนูสวน)</li>
        <li>8 - 10 Cloves of garlic (กระเทียม)</li>
        <li>6 - 10 tablespoons of lime (น้ำมะนาว)</li>
        <li>3 Tablespoons of water (น้ำเปล่า)</li>
        <li>2 - 4 Tablespoons of fishsauce (น้ำปลา). An alternate can be salt and some fishsauce
            if you do not like the 'fishy' sauce flavor. Some Thai folks prefer using salt in
            their seafood sauce. Also, the water and lime can cut the salty taste so add accordingly.</li>

        <li>1 Tablespoon of sugar or preferably, palm sugar (น้ำตาล)</li>

    <!-- Ordered list of step by step cooking instructions -->
    <ol>
        <li>Add the Thai birds eye chilies and peeled garlic into a mortar and pestle. Toss in 1/2
            teaspoon of salt, start pounding until chilies and garlic are smashed. Make sure that
            all of the oils are released and seeds are crushed. The alternative way is the throw
            everything into a blender but the traditional way is the mortar and pestle.</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Important Side Note: Do not look direct down into the mortar and pestle while
                    pounding to avoid chili seeds flying up into your eyes! You can use a paper towel
                    to cover the top of the mortar while pounding instead for added safety.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Scoop out the crushed chilies and garlic with a spoon and put it into a bowl.</li>
        <li>Add your lime juice, water, and fish sauce back into the mortar and pestle to get the extra oil
            stuck in the walls of the mortar. This is where a lot of the real flavor is hiding! Stir.</li>
        <li>Pour the juice into the bowl of crushed chilies and garlic.</li>
        <li>Taste and repeat to until if fits your preference. Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
